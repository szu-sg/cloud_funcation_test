# Introduction
This template aims to help get you started on developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more information.

# Get started

By default, MarsCode runs the **start** script, but you can configure it by changing the configuration in the **.vscode/launch.json**. Refer to [Visual Studio Code's doc](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) for how to configure launch.json.
